### ‚ñ™Ô∏è Android Developer ‚ô• Kotlin ‚ô• Jetpack Compose

<p>
Hello! My name is Orlando, I am a native mobile application developer for the Android platform. I have spent several years in a process of continuous learning of new technologies, libraries, best practices of architecture, Kotlin, Coroutines, reactive functional programming and a while ago I started with the study of Jetpack Compose. Over the course of all this time I have had the opportunity to gain new knowledge by paying close attention to all phases of mobile application development from initial idea, planning and requirements gathering to successful product delivery. All this has allowed me to have a greater command of the patterns and the best practices to follow for the development of high quality mobile applications and I have applied this knowledge in each of the projects in which I have participated.

In the course of my career as a developer, I have used several frameworks such as Flutter, React, NodeJs with which I have helped to create excellent products for both web and mobile; But some time ago I made the decision to specialize in Native Android Development and since then I have remained in that branch of software development which I consider the best line of work for me.

I have acquired skills with the following tools and libraries that have allowed me to have good productivity when creating mobile applications.

## Dominated Technologies:

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) a REST Client for Android which makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
* [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion.
* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to handle all navigations and also passing of data between destinations.
* [Work Manager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) to manage Android background jobs.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design.
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) used to manage the local storage i.e. `writing to and reading from the database`. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) to declaratively bind UI components in layouts to data sources.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) persistence library which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging) helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time.
* [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) which helps to write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
* [Preferences](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings) to create interactive settings screens.
* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) Jetpack Compose is Android‚Äôs modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
